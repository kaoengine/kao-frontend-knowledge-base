How to Start Learning JavaScript?
This is obviously an important question. Not only where do you start, but how do you proceed so that you learn JavaScript the right way, become the type of JavaScript programmer that you want to become. 

Some of the things that make it difficult to know exactly where to start with JavaScript is first that JavaScript is everywhere. Traditionally, it was in browsers. But that's not the only place anymore. You can use JavaScript on the desktop. 

You can use JavaScript on mobile platforms. And of course, JavaScript is available to be used on a server as well. So JavaScript is indeed everywhere. 

And then on top of that, there are so many libraries and frameworks available for JavaScript that address different areas. As different topics different ways to use JavaScript to accomplish programming tasks.

There are so many libraries and frameworks, it can make it very confusing. And these are just a few of the more popular ones. So where do you start? Well, I thought I'd put together just a few thoughts on how to go about learning JavaScript and becoming a JavaScript developer. 

First off, I think there are two approaches that work fairly well. One, which has become very popular of late is a Coding Bootcamp. Now, not all coding boot camps focus on JavaScript, but there are coding boot camps out there that do focus on JavaScript. 

And in case you have not heard of this term, basically what it is is you set aside three months of your life. You pay some money to a group that does this, and then you spend those three months working with others to learn to program, and there are coding boot camps that focus on the JavaScript stack. 

And so you get to learn JavaScript on the browser side JavaScript on the server-side JavaScript on the desktop, you get to learn JavaScript quite well. The downside of those coding boot camps is you have to set aside around three months of your life. It's like a full-time school for three months. 

You go in the morning, and you come home in the evening, and the whole time you're there doing JavaScript. That's both an advantage and a disadvantage. Another disadvantage is it does cost quite a bit of money. 

And so if you're not able to dedicate that time or that money, then you may want to look at a self-study approach. Now some of the advantages of a self-study approach are obviously less expensive. You can also learn from multiple sources at boot camp. You do get to learn from several instructors, but it's not a wide variety. Where was self-taught? 

The study, you could be taking online courses from certain instructors, you would then be learning from books. So different authors would be giving you their information and their approaches to JavaScript. 

I like that. And I think that's an advantage of the self-study approach. Obviously, with self-study, you can control your own program, you can decide what you're going to learn. And finally, you can fit it into the time that you have available, you don't have to dedicate the entire three months to learn it. 

There are also programs at community colleges and universities where you would learn JavaScript however, you have to take a lot of other courses as well. So that's why I did not include that as one of the approaches. 

Now, here's what I think are the steps towards a self-study approach. Here are Some steps to guide you. First off, I think you should focus on learning JavaScript fundamentals, I feel this is very important. 

JavaScript is such that you can jump in and start doing things right away. The danger of that is you find success. And you begin to ignore all the fundamentals. And you focus on what you're doing. those fundamentals are important. You need to learn JavaScript the right way. 

So make sure you're not skipping JavaScript topics in order to get a task done. Once you've learned those JavaScript fundamentals, then I think it's great to work on a project. Sometimes if you start by working on a project, it causes you to focus in a certain area and you ignore other parts of the language. 

But once you have the fundamentals down, then it's important to start working on projects to increase your skills and your understanding of JavaScript. those projects can be once you make up. They can be something you're doing by yourself.

If you want, or it could be a project that's part of your job or a project that you're doing for a friend or something like that. But that's an important second step, then I think it's important to begin focusing on the advanced topics of JavaScript. 

In the next slide, I have some of the things that I feel are advanced topics. If you're wondering, Well, what are those advanced topics? Now, this step three doesn't mean that you ought to suddenly stop doing projects and focus on advanced topics.

It's just that as you are doing those projects, make sure you're learning in more depth the advanced topics of JavaScript. Then at that point, you can begin learning the libraries and frameworks, decide where you want to focus as a JavaScript coder, and then begin to learn those libraries or frameworks that apply to where you're working or that you're interested in using on your own.

If you have this grounding of fundamentals and this grounding of advanced topics, the libraries and frameworks make more sense are much faster to learn, and you will be much better able to apply them. Finally, you should become a student of the language and never stop learning about JavaScript. 

There is a lot to JavaScript, which is the exciting part of learning JavaScript. To become a student of the language and continue to learn. Now, I mentioned that I put down some of the advanced topics, some of the things that I think are important to have a good grounding with JavaScript. 

Some of these, you will begin to learn in fundamental courses, the fundamental course that we offer at all things JavaScript begins introducing some of these topics. And then in our advanced courses, we go into a lot more detail. 

So I provide these slides you have a reference to what I feel are some of the important advanced topics in JavaScript. Finally, if you're interested, I would love to have you take our courses which we offer at all things JavaScript calm. 

We feel it's very important to teach JavaScript the right way. And we have a series called learn modern JavaScript that deals with the fundamentals and then deals with more advanced topics. 
So if you're interested in our courses, you can visit all things JavaScript Comm. 
What is JavaScript?
 
That's coming up Wow alright so javascript is one of the three core languages of websites now. The first one is HTML we've already seen. That it controls the structure of your web page if he had HTML tags. 

The second one is CSS and this is more to do with the presentation and design of your website. So, you can change colors or change the layout of your HTML in CSS and the third one is JavaScript and JavaScript is responsible for adding additional behavior and interactivity to your website so make it more interesting.

So say for example you had a website with a gallery on and in that gallery you want users to be able to click to zoom in and out of your images if you wanted to do that then you my friends would probably need JavaScript to do it now javascript is a scripting language and many programmers will just disregard.

It as a scripting language, not a programming language, and by that they mean it's intentionally limited. It doesn't have the same features as other programming languages such as C sharp C++ or Java in that it can't communicate with databases directly or file systems on a computer.

Other things however its intended purpose was to add interactivity and to manipulate webpages and for that my friends it's magnificent now javascript is a client-side language and essentially.
What that means is that it runs on your computer in your browser ok so when you type in a URL into your browser that communicates with a server.

it gets the information from the server which brings it back to your computer in the browser and displays.

It to you in the form of a web page and that my friends is a combination of HTML CSS and probably JavaScript. So all of those three-run on your browser on your computer that's what it's meant by a client-side language.

This is different from other programming languages such as Ruby on Rails PHP and a peed on there they all run on a server. So if you go to a website running one of these technologies you're typing the URL communicate with the server.

The code will run on the server and then send the results of that code to your web browser where it's displayed on a webpage. So javascript is client-side all the programming languages are server-side.
I would say also not to rely on JavaScript to add functionality to your website, now imagine you had a website and it sold out in the saan line. 

If you were to add some kind of behavior to that website which relied on javascript for example a user couldn't add an item to their shopping basket without JavaScript enabled. Then that website is not very good you want to make a website. 

That's going to be accessible to everyone regardless of whether they're using javascript or not. So, make it without JavaScript first to make sure.

It runs completely fine on its own and then adds javascript to it to give.it that magic touch and the added interactivity and finally I'm going to say this javascript is not and has nothing to do with Java.
Java is a completely separate language and javascript is just a name. 

That was given to it while Java was really popular so they jumped on that bandwagon the official name for javascript is Atma script but we all refer to it as JavaScript.
So that's about it for this introduction to JavaScript to hope now you've got.
History Of Javascript
Decades ago when the language was first created, who would have thought JavaScript something that was meant to be a scripting language for the browser would become synonymous with web development. With thousands of frameworks in place today to fulfill each and every requirement of us, we have come a long way.

In this video, we go back in time and see how we got to where we are today. The year was 1993. When the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, the NCSA released NCSA mosaic. The specialty of this browser was that it was the first graphical web browser, which means it displayed graphics such as images, in addition to just the text in the year 1994.

In Mountain View, California, a company was founded by the name mosaic communications. They recruited the initial authors who wrote the NCSA mosaic to rewrite the exact same product, which they called mosaic Netscape, mosaic Netscape turned out to be a huge success.

Within the first four months of its release, it became the leading browser in the market at that time, capturing 75% of the market share. Toward legal issues, the name of the browser was changed to Netscape Navigator and the company was renamed to Netscape Communications.

To ride on the wave of this accelerated growth, and to engage more and more people with this browser. The founder of the company was looking for a programming language for this browser. he envisioned it to be easy, so that everyone could code on it, and that web designers could use it to embed snippets of code into the markup for their pages.

In the year 1995, Brendan Eich was given the cola task to design and develop the set programming language for the web browser and present a prototype. Brendan accepted the challenge and came up with an initial draft in 10 days.

It had bare minimum functionality, but the main part was that it was functional. And that time, nobody could have thought that This piece of code was initial draft was written in such haste would someday go on to conquer the world of web development as we know it.

The draft version of JavaScript was called mocha when it was first released. Later, in the beta version of Netscape Navigator 2.0. Its name was changed to a live script. And then in the beta three of Netscape Navigator 2.0, it was named as JavaScript.

The language was nowhere close to Java in its core design or functionality, but it was intentionally named JavaScript. This is alleged to be a strategic move in order to hear the Java developer community which was flourishing at that time to come to develop on the web browser.

The move was an attempt to make them feel more at home. Looking at Netscape releasing JavaScript, Microsoft, rather than joining them made their own separate plans. They released their own scripting languages for the web browser, VB script, and JavaScript macros. did not want to lose the browser battle to Netscape. So much.

So that j script is often called the reverse-engineered version of JavaScript that was created for Internet Explorer three. But each of these implementations of features was inherently different for iOS and Netscape, which proved to be a pain point for developers who struggled to support both the browsers with their code to bring a kind of stability to the situation.

Netscape submitted JavaScript to ACMA international in order to define standards to be implemented, which could then be shared with other browser vendors so that they can implement similar functionality in their browsers. The standardization organization released the ACMA script, which was published in the ACMA 262 standard, released in June 1997.

With JavaScript being the most well-known implementation of that standard, subsequent versions of the standard where at least one after the other ECMAScript two in June 1998 ACMA script three in December 1999. But even though the work for ECMAScript, four was started in 2000, it never actually got released.

This was because Microsoft, a major player in the browser market had made its intentions clear to not implement proper JavaScript in the Internet Explorer. Not that they have any competing proposals for the same. This had its impact on the ACMA script for release which got dragged forever.
Finally, Microsoft got help from Douglas Crockford with whom they started working on ECMAScript 3.1.
By law that chaos was taking place. 

There were great things that were happening for JavaScript as well. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett came up with something revolutionary. He coined the term Ajax for a set of technologies whose core was based in JavaScript These technologies enable webpages to perform network-related tasks in the background, which improved page reloads and made the pages more dynamic. 

This sort of kick-started the JavaScript open-source movement, wherein more and more libraries started getting written in JavaScript and active community started getting created around them. 
Some of the most popular ones from those are prototype, the dojo framework, and the most popular of them all jQuery. 

Meanwhile, to fix all the chaos that was going on in the JavaScript standards world, all the parties concerned decided to meet in July of 2008. At Oslo, it was decided that ECMAScript 3.1 was to be renamed as ECMAScript five unreleased. 

Also an agenda was created to drive all the future engagement of the parties and that agenda was named as harmony. Does ECMAScript five was released? In December of 2009, and since then, several releases have happened. 

The most popular of them being ACMA script 2015, also known popularly as es six. By the time ACMA script five was released in 2009, JavaScript had become the language of the web. 
developers who earlier did not give the language enough respect, who considered it to be a tool for web designers to tweak their websites now started to take it seriously. 

This resulted in a huge engagement from the community framework started getting developed in JavaScript, which started to get more traction. JavaScript was now not just a browser-specific language, but a server-side language as well. 

Also, the prevalence of single-page applications meant more and more important to JavaScript on the beach. And this was good news to trust the result of these and many other factors, the popularity and reach of john Script grew many-fold over the next few years. 

JavaScript has captured territories that were considered unsuitable for the language to even enter. The rate at which new frameworks are coming up is unheard of before for any other programming language, JavaScript rules over the browser, the front end development, back end development server-side, even IoT devices like Alexa and Google Home, published their development environment in JavaScript before any other language. 

The language surely has come a long way. But now, what next? Where are we headed? What is the future for a language which is so hot right now that every other day we have a new framework, overthrowing an old one for performance, ease of implementation, etc? The boon of JavaScript that is accelerated development is turning out to be one of its pain points.
