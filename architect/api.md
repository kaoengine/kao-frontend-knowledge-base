## What is API

It's like a conversation interface, but for the digital world.

> At my previous company, we were talking about few Java developers that they have a "heavy interface" -> meaning "they are not most communicative, and close to a cave man"

- Do you like when people call you `Mr/Mrs/Miss/Sir`?
- What is your pronoun?
- Do you care about your titles, should we say `doctor` or `professor`
- Are you in the mood for a talk?
- Can I make jokes about Trump?

Wouldn't it be nice to have it documented and publicly available? Oh wait -> [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/)

## Sync vs Async

## What is a Protocol

Good real-life example is the `dyplomatic protocol`:
- Is guest on the right hand side of the host?
- when national anthem is played
- what with the flags?

It is a set of rules that describe how information is transmited.

HTTP protocol on example of https://www.asyncapi.com/ :

## Specifications

* HTTP protocol:
  * [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) for REST API (although 3.1 no longer mentions it)
  * [GraphQL](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/)
* Async-related protocols:
  * [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec)
  * [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec)
  * [Schema Registry](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/schemaregistry/spec.md)

## Event Driven Architecture (EDA)

Q: Why do you do event-driven API, is REST API not enough?
A: Because I want to know what is happening in real-time without asking for an update constantly.

OR

When you send a message, and definitely do not expect a response.

## EDA is pretty old

Just look at the browser and `mouseover` event:

Microservices brought event-driven into `renesance`.
Serverless puts it to the moon.

## EDA protocols

amqp, http, ibmmq, jms, **kafka**, anypointmq, **mqtt**, solace, stomp, **websocket**, mercure

## EDA Docs

- Most complex to document because of different protocols
- Not widely visible as REST API
  - [Programmableweb](https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis) - 24,471 (Async APIs around 170)
  - [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/categories) - Thousands! 
  - [APIs Guru](https://apis.guru/) - 2,351 OpenAPI examples!
  - [APITracker](https://www.apitracker.io/specifications/asyncapi) - 7 AsyncAPI examples...
- REMEMBER: spec is not all you need

## EDA Setup - Simplified

> These two perspectives cause some headache in AsyncAPI
* Clients & Server
  <br/>
    ```mermaid
    graph TD
      server1[Server -> ws://flypoland.pl/travel/status]
      user1[Client -> Browser]
      user1 --> server1
      user2[Client -> Mobile]
      user2 --> server1
    ```
  <br/>
* Producers, consumers and message broker in the middle -> `fire and forget`
