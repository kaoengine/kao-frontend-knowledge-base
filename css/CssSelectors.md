# CSS SELECTORS

### In CSS, Selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style.

#### We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

- Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class).

- Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them).
- Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state).
- Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element).
- Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value).

# The CSS element Selector - Simple Selectors

The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

### Example:

Here, all `<p>` elements on the page will be **center-aligned**, with a **red text color**:

```CSS
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```

### The CSS id Selector

The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

_`The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!`_

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash `(#)` character, followed by the id of the element.

### Example:

The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with `id="para"`:

```CSS
#para {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```

### The CSS class Selector

The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. And there are **3 common cases** that we can use as below:

1. To select elements with a specific class, write a period `(.)` character, followed by the class name.

### Example

In this example all HTML elements with `class="center"` will be **red** and **center-aligned**:

```CSS
.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```

2. You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

### Example

In this example **_only_** `<p>` elements with `class="center"` will be `center-aligned`:

```CSS
p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```

3. HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

### Example

In this example the `<p>` element will be styled according to `class="center"` and to `class="large"`:

```CSS
<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
```

#### Try these below to understand clearly how it works

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	    <title>Class Selectors</title>
    <style>
        p.center {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
        }

        p.large {
            font-size: 300%;
        }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1 class="center">
            This heading will not be affected
        </h1>
        <p class="center">
            This paragraph will be red and center-aligned.
        </p>
        <p class="center large">
            This paragraph will be red, center-aligned, and in a large font-size.
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

### The CSS Universal Selector

The universal selector `(*)` selects all HTML elements on the page.

### Example

The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page:

```CSS
* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
```

### The CSS Grouping Selector

The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` elements have the same style definitions):

```CSS
h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```

It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.

To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

```CSS
h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```

# Combinator Selectors

## 1. Descendant:

Represented by a single space `( )` character â€” combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor (parent, parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc) element matching the first selector. Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.

In Summary:
The `element element` selector is used to select elements inside elements.

### Example 1: Based on HTML Tag

```htmL
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Document</title>

    <style>
        li {
            list-style-type: upper-roman;
            }

        li li {
            list-style-type: circle;
        }

    </style>

    </head>
    <body>

    <ul>

        <li><!-- it will be styled as upper-roman -->
            <div>Item 1</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Element A</li> <!-- it will be styled as circle -->
                <li>Element B</li><!-- it will be styled as circle -->
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><!-- it will be styled as upper-roman -->
            <div>Item 2</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Element A</li><!-- it will be styled as circle -->
                <li>Element B</li><!-- it will be styled as circle -->
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Example 2: Based on ID selector `id="main-content"` and HTML tag `<p>`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
      #main-content p {
        background-color: #111;
        color: #fff;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- All the <p> tags inside of the parent id="main-content" are styled -->
    <div id="main-content">
      <p>Hello There <strong>ninjas!</strong>Contact us below</p>
      <p>Ain't paragraph cool?</p>
      <p>Hey Hey!</p>
      <div id="sub-content">
        <p>More Content</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!--  -->

    <p>Is This Styled?</p>
    <!-- this won't be styled -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## 2. Adjacent sibling:

The adjacent sibling combinator `(+)` separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it immediately follows the first element, and both are children of the same parent element.

> Note: This is stricter than the descendant combinator, which matches all elements matched by the second selector for which there exists an ancestor element matched by the first selector.

### Example 1:

Select and style every `<p>` element that are placed immediately after `<div>` elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      div + p {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <h2>Oh No! I am not Colored!</h2>
      <p>Hey Div! I am your children, let me be colored.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- This <p> is styled -->
    <p><strong>Yes! I am going to be colored.<strong></p>
    <!--  -->

    <p>I will not be colored, won't I?</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Example 2:

```CSS
li:first-of-type + li {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>1</li>
  <li>2</li>
  <li>3</li>
</ul>
```

> Note: As example above we can see `'li:first-of-type'` the meaning is the first `<li>` tag is chosen and it targets the next sibling element which is the second `<li>2</li>`.

> However, if we **_remove_** the `'first-of-type'`. It targets both `<li>2</li>` and `<li>3</li>`

## 3. Child

The child combinator `(>)` is placed between two CSS selectors. It matches only those elements matched by the second selector that are the children of elements matched by the first

### Example 1:

```CSS
div > span {
  background-color: DodgerBlue;
}
```

```html
<div>
  <!-- all the span tag inside of div will be styled -->
  <span
    >Span #1, in the div.
    <span>Span #2, in the span that's in the div.</span>
  </span>
  <!--  -->
</div>
<span>Span #3, not in the div at all.</span>
```

### Example 2:

> Try this example below - it is similar to the example of Descendant - but I've already added 1 one more tag`<section>`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
      #main-content > p {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="main-content">
      <p>Hello There <strong>ninjas!</strong>Contact us below</p>
      <p>Ain't paragraph cool?</p>

      <!-- the p tag inside the parent of Section won't be styled -->
      <section>
        <p>hey hey!</p>
      </section>
      <!--  -->

      <!-- all the p in id="sub-content" won't be styled -->
      <div id="sub-content">
        <p>More Content</p>
      </div>
      <!--  -->
    </div>

    <p>Is This Styled?</p>
    <!-- this won't be styled -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## 4. General sibling

The general sibling combinator `(~)` separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it follows the first element (though not necessarily immediately), and both are children of the same parent element.

### Example 1:

```CSS
p ~ span {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<span>This is not red.</span>
<p>Here is a paragraph.</p>
<code>Here is some code.</code>

<!-- this span is styled! -->
<span>And here is a red span!</span>

<code>More code...</code>

<!-- this span is styled! -->
<span>And this is a red span!</span>
```

### Example 2: Try to guess what happened to this example?

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
      p ~ ul {
        background-color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>A div element.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Coffee</li>
      <li>Tea</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- start from p tag , all the children <li> of contained ul tag will be styled -->
    <p>The first paragraph.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Coffee</li>
      <li>Tea</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Another list</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Coffee</li>
      <li>Tea</li>
      <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

# Pseudo-class selectors

#### Syntax

```CSS
elements:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
```

## I. Pseudo-class selectors for link and user states

A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

- Style an element when a user mouses over it.
- Style visited and unvisited links differently.
- Style an element when it gets focus.

There are some basic usuages for this section:

- The `:link` CSS pseudo-class represents an element that has not yet been visited. It matches every unvisited `<a>`, `<area>`, or `<link>` element that has an href attribute.

- The `:active` CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.

- The `:visited` CSS pseudo-class represents links that the user has already visited. For privacy reasons, the styles that can be modified using this selector are very limited.

- The `:focus` CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's "tab" key.

- The `:hover` CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
      a:link {
        color: blue;
      } /* Unvisited links */
      a:visited {
        color: purple;
      } /* Visited links */
      a:hover {
        background: yellow;
      } /* Hovered links */
      a:active {
        color: red;
      } /* Active links */

      p:active {
        background: #eee;
      } /* Active paragraphs */

      input:focus {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This paragraph contains a link:
      <a href="#">This link will turn red while you click on it.</a>
      The paragraph will get a gray background while you click on it or the
      link.
    </p>
    <input type="text" />
  </body>
</html>
```

## II. Pseudo-class selectors that apply to siblings

1. The `:first-child` CSS pseudo-class represents the first element among a group of sibling elements.

```CSS
p:first-child {
  color: lime;
  background-color: black;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

```html
<div>
  <p>This text is selected!</p>
  <p>This text isn't selected.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>This text isn't selected: it's not a `p`.</h2>
  <p>This text isn't selected.</p>
</div>
```

2. The `:last-child` CSS pseudo-class represents the last element among a group of sibling elements.

```CSS
p:last-child {
  color: lime;
  background-color: black;
  padding: 5px;
}
```

```html
<div>
  <p>This text isn't selected.</p>
  <p>This text is selected!</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>This text isn't selected.</p>
  <h2>This text isn't selected: it's not a `p`.</h2>
</div>
```

3. The `:only-child` CSS pseudo-class represents an element without any siblings. This is the same as `:first-child`, `:last-child` or `:nth-child(1)`, `:nth-last-child(1)`, but with a lower specificity.

```CSS
div:only-child {
  color: red;
}

div {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 6px;
  outline: 1px solid;
}
```

```html
<div>
  <div>I am an only child.</div>
</div>

<div>
  <div>I am the 1st sibling.</div>
  <div>I am the 2nd sibling.</div>
  <div>
    I am the 3rd sibling,
    <div>but this is an only child.</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

4. The `:first-of-type` CSS pseudo-class represents the first element of its type among a group of sibling elements.

```CSS
p:first-of-type {
  color: red;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

```html
<h2>Heading</h2>
<p>This Paragraph 1 will be styled</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
```

5. The `:last-of-type` CSS pseudo-class represents the last element of its type among a group of sibling elements.

```css
p:last-of-type {
  color: red;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

```html
<h2>Heading</h2>
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>This Paragraph 2 will be styled</p>
```

6. The `:only-of-type` CSS pseudo-class represents an element that has no siblings of the same type.

```CSS
main :only-of-type {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<main>
  <div>I am `div` #1.</div>
  <p>I am the only `p` among my siblings.</p>
  <div>I am `div` #2.</div>
  <div>
    I am `div` #3.
    <i>I am the only `i` child.</i>
    <em>I am `em` #1.</em>
    <em>I am `em` #2.</em>
  </div>
</main>
```

7. The `:nth-child()` CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on their position in a group of siblings.

```CSS
p:nth-child(2) {
  background: red;
}
```

```html
<p>The first paragraph.</p>
<p>The second paragraph is styled.</p>
<p>The third paragraph.</p>
<p>The fourth paragraph.</p>
```

8. The `:nth-last-child()` CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on their position among a group of siblings, counting from the end.

```CSS
p:nth-last-child(2) {
  background: red;
}
```

```html
<p>The first paragraph.</p>
<p>The second paragraph.</p>
<p>The third paragraph is styled.</p>
<p>The fourth paragraph.</p>
```

9. The `:nth-of-type()` CSS pseudo-class matches elements of a given type, based on their position among a group of siblings.

```CSS
p:nth-of-type(2) {
  background: red;
}
```

```html
<p>The first paragraph.</p>
<p>The second paragraph is styled.</p>
<p>The third paragraph.</p>
<p>The fourth paragraph.</p>
```

10. The `:nth-last-of-type()` CSS pseudo-class matches elements of a given type, based on their position among a group of siblings, counting from the end.

```CSS
p:nth-last-of-type(2) {
  background: red;
}
```

```html
<p>The first paragraph.</p>
<p>The second paragraph.</p>
<p>The third paragraph.</p>
<p>The fourth paragraph is styled.</p>

<p>I am here to make you confused</p>
```

# Pseudo-element selectors

1. The `::first-letter` CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first letter of the first line of a block-level element, but only when not preceded by other content (such as images or inline tables).

```css
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 200%;
  color: #8a2be2;
}
```

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Homepage</h1>

<p>My name is Donald.</p>
<p>I live in Duckburg.</p>
<p>My best friend is Mickey.</p>
```

2. The `::first-line` CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first line of a block-level element. Note that the length of the first line depends on many factors, including the width of the element, the width of the document, and the font size of the text.

```CSS
p::first-line {
  background-color: yellow;
  /* what if we add font-size? */
  /* font-size: 48px; */
}
```

```html
<h1>WWF's Mission Statement</h1>
<p>
  To stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a
  future in which humans live in harmony with nature, by; conserving the world's
  biological diversity, ensuring that the use of renewable natural resources is
  sustainable, and promoting the reduction of pollution and wasteful
  consumption.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Note:</b> For this selector to work in IE 5.5-8, you must specify the old,
  single-colon CSS2 syntax (:first-line instead of ::first-line).
</p>
```

3. In CSS, `::before` creates a pseudo-element that is the **first child** of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.

4. Oppsotie to `::after` creates a pseudo-element that is the **last child** of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.

```CSS
q::before {
  content: "Â«";
  color: blue;
}

q::after {
  content: "Â»";
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<p>My name is Donald</p>
<p>I live in Ducksburg</p>
```

# Attribute selectors: Welcome to Advanced Topic :)

## 1. Presence and value selectors:

| Seletor        | Example                       | Example description                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [attr]         | a[title]                      | Matches elements with an attr attribute (whose name is the value in square brackets).                                            |
| [attr=value]   | a[href="https://example.com"] | Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value is exactly value â€” the string inside the quotes.                             |
| [attr~=value]  | p[class~="special"]           | Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value is exactly value, or contains value in its (space separated) list of values. |
| [attr\|=value] | div[lang\|="zh"]              | Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value is exactly value or begins with value immediately followed by a hyphen.      |

> I know it is super confused, but We will guide you through these complicated stuffs.

> How about we check this example and slowly get it slowly below:

- `li[class]` we can match any selector with a class attribute. This matches all of the list items except the first one.

- `li[class="a"]` matches the selector with class of a, but not the selector with class of b with another space-separated class as part of the value(`class="b"`). It selects the second list item.

- `li[class~="a"]` will match a class of a but also a value that contains the class of a as part of a whitespace-separated list. It selects the second and third list items.

```CSS
/* this style is going to look through all <li> tag */
/* if there is any <li> with class. The font-size will be activated */
li[class] {
    font-size: 200%;
}

/* this style causes the second line which is item 2 to be yellow */
/* it matched class a  */
/* the third line which is item 3 won't be yellow, because there is another class="b" */
li[class="a"] {
    background-color: yellow;
}

/* it matched with all class="a" but also matched with class="b" */
/* which are item 2 and item 3 */
li[class~="a"] {
    color: red;
}
```

```html
<h1>Attribute presence and value selectors</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li class="a">Item 2</li>
  <li class="a b">Item 3</li>
  <li class="ab">Item 4</li>
</ul>
```

## 2 .Substring matching selectors

These selectors allow for more advanced matching of substrings inside the value of your attribute. For example, if you had classes of `box-warning` and `box-error` and wanted to match everything that started with the string `"box-"`, you could use `[class^="box-"]` to select them both (or `[class|="box"]` as described in section above).

| Seletor       | Example           | Example description                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [attr^=value] | li[class^="box-"] | Matches elements with an attr attribute (whose name is the value in square brackets), whose value begins with value. |
| [attr$=value] | li[class$="-box"] | Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value ends with value.                                                 |
| [attr*=value] | li[class*="box"]  | Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value contains value anywhere within the string.                       |

The below example shows usage of these selectors:

- `li[class^="a"]` matches any attribute value which starts with a, so matches the first two list items.

- `li[class$="a"]` matches any attribute value that ends with a, so matches the first and third list item.

- `li[class*="a"]` matches any attribute value where a appears anywhere in the string, so it matches all of our list items.

```CSS
/* start with "a" */
li[class^="a"] {
    font-size: 200%;
}

/* end with "a" */
li[class$="a"] {
    background-color: yellow;
}

/* match all */
li[class*="a"] {
    color: red;
}

```

```html
<h1>Attribute substring matching selectors</h1>
<ul>
  <li class="a">Item 1</li>
  <li class="ab">Item 2</li>
  <li class="bca">Item 3</li>
  <li class="bcabc">Item 4</li>
</ul>
```

## 3. Case-sensitivity

If you want to match attribute values `case-insensitively` you can use the value `i` before the closing bracket. This flag tells the browser to match `ASCII characters` case-insensitively. Without the flag the values will be matched according to the case-sensitivity of the document language â€” in HTML's case it will be case sensitive.

> Give it a try! :)

```css
li[class^="a"] {
  background-color: yellow;
}

li[class^="a" i] {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<h1>Case-insensitivity</h1>
<ul>
  <li class="a">Item 1</li>
  <li class="A">Item 2</li>
  <li class="Ab">Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

## 4. Misc selectors

There are some other selectors you can use as well. Look at some as below:

- `:not(selector)`

```CSS
.box {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      border: 1px solid steelblue;
      margin: 10px;
    }

/* it means whatever element in the body, it will add background-color: red */
/* but with class="special", hell no! */
body :not(.special) {
  background-color: red;
}
```

```html
<h1>:not() pseudo-class - CSS3 -</h1>
<div class="box"></div>
<div class="box special"></div>
<div class="box"></div>
```

Interesting! but What if I just want 2 boxes without `"special"` being colored background?

```CSS
/* it means whatever the boxes are going to be colored */
/* but with class="special", No! */
/* pay attention to .box:not() it does not seperate the space */
.box:not(.special) {
            background-color: red;
          }
```

2. The `:root` selector matches the document's root element.

> In HTML, the root element is always the html element.

```CSS
:root {
  background: yellow;
}
```

> **Wait.....! what are the differences among `:root`, `html` and `*` ?**

Here is the advanced topic for you guys! Discuss about it! The answer is below :

One technical difference between them is that `:root` - being a `pseudo class` has a greater specificity than `html` (a type selector).

and the `*` means that will select all elements only.

```CSS
/* this will override the html tag */
:root {
        background: green;
      }

/* not a chance to display, because :root takes over */
html {
  background: blue;
}

/* it will display within the pages of all elements */
*{
  background: tomato;
}
```

3. The `:empty` selector matches every element that has no children (including text nodes).

```CSS
p:empty {
  width: 100px;
  height: 20px;
  background: #ff0000;
}
```

```html
<!-- this empty text P will be styled -->
<p></p>
<p>A paragraph.</p>
<p>Another paragraph.</p>
```

4. `in-range` and `out-of-range`

The `:in-range` selector selects all elements with a value that is within a specified range.

The `:out-of-range` selector selects all elements with a value that is outside a specified range.

Note: The `:in-range` and `:out-of-range` selector only works for `input` elements with min and/or max attributes!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
      li {
        list-style: none;
        margin-bottom: 1em;
      }

      input {
        border: 1px solid black;
      }

      input:in-range {
        background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.25);
      }

      input:out-of-range {
        background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.25);
        border: 2px solid red;
      }

      input:in-range + label::after {
        content: "okay.";
      }

      input:out-of-range + label::after {
        content: "out of range!";
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form action="" id="form1">
      <p>Values between 1 and 10 are valid.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <input
            id="value1"
            name="value1"
            type="number"
            placeholder="1 to 10"
            min="1"
            max="10"
            value="12"
          />
          <label for="value1">Your value is </label>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```
