<h2 id="what-is-a-layout">What is a layout?</h2>
<p>Imagine that you recently moved to a new room. The room is not big, but you have a lot of luggage to put in. In order not to make this room cluttered and difficult to find what you want, you decided to plan this space. Where to start? From large pieces to small pieces, the bed is best to the balcony, the desk can be close to the window, so the view is better, the cabinet is placed in the aisle, the shelf is divided into multiple grids, and books, cups, daily necessities are placed separately… Did you find it? You are laying out your room, putting things in the right place, making them easy to find and pleasing to the eye. In fact, the webpage layout is similar. The web page is essentially a medium for information display and communication. In the general interaction design stage, the first thing to determine is the layout of the web page. Because the amount of information to be communicated to the user is large, it can make the information acquisition cost very high. As with room layout, you need to put the right information in the right place. The web page layout is the skeleton of information organization. A good web page layout can make the information organization clear and clear. The web page can complete the information transmission more efficiently. Users can obtain the required information with little cost and grow and operate the entire website. Maintain the stability of the information structure. The following diagram is a common layout of some web pages:</p>

<h4 id="section-scrolling-new">SECTION SCROLLING (*NEW)</h4>
<p>Inspired by our Fullpane theme, full section scrolling feature allows viewers to scroll through your page design one row at a time like a presentation slideshow. Full section scrolling now comes with Horizontal and Vertical scrolling.</p>

<p>More than being creative, a good artist must also consider subtleties like composition, colors, size, what to include, and — perhaps more importantly — what to leave out. That’s no easy feat, which is why we hold the masters like da Vinci and Van Gogh in such high regard.</p>

<p>Just as with a scurrying movement in the corner of your eye or a sexy walk from someone across the street, the human eye is drawn automatically to certain points of interest. While some of this depends on the person, the majority of people tend to follow definite trends — including how they view a web page.</p>

<p>As discussed in Web UI Best Practices, one of the most important tricks in making something pretty is the absolute absence of something pretty. Cluttering too many attractive images together is a quick way to ruin them all. It’s important that your web interface has breathing room and that you space everything out. Reducing the amount of “visual noise” will make the points you want to keep even stronger</p>
