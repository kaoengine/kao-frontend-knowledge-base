# TypeScript With Me

## *JavaScript that scales.*

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.


# TypeScript

``` js
// JavaScript, types are implicit
const add = (a, b) => a + b
```

``` ts
// TypeScript, types are explicit
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b
```

# Why Types?

- Catch bugs
- Catch bugs (earlier)
- Documentation / improve productivity
- GraphQL has a type system
- **ðŸ¤© Refactoring**

Java?

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number1 = 10;
        String message = new String("Hello World! ");
        System.out.println(message + number1);
    }
}
```

> _Matz_: Yeah
the third major goal of the Ruby 3 is adding some kind of static typing while keeping the duck typing
so some kind of structure for soft-typing or something like that.

# Why TypeScript?

- gradual pragmatic
- good adoption story
- Community adoption
- VS Code & Language server
- Apollo
- Formik are authored in it

---

## Gradual Adoption Story

- All JS is valid TS!
- Rename `*.js` -> `*.ts{x}`
- Introduce types for libraries
- Dial up the strictness (towards `--strict` mode)

    ```
    --noImplicitAny
    --strictNullChecks
    --strictFunctionTypes
    ```

---

## Community Adoption

## Tooling!

---
## Library Support

- Apollo & formik are authored in TypeScript
- React very well supported

---

## How to get started

- All JS is valid TS!
- Rename `*.js` -> `*.ts{x}`
- Introduce types for libraries
- Dial up the strictness (towards `--strict` mode)

    ```
    --noImplicitAny
    --strictNullChecks
    --strictFunctionTypes
    ```

## Core concept 
- Type system
- Self Confidence
- Decipherable
- Observable
- Contractor
- Transparent
- Isolate the problem quickly
- Non-exception Failures 
- Explicit Types
- Erased Types
- DownLeveling
- Strictness

## Common Questions:
1. Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces? *Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely. Almost all features of an interface are available in type , the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.*
