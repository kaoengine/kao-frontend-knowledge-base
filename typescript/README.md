TypeScript Intro
================

This repo contains the presentation content and coding samples for an intro to
TypeScript presentation I recently gave.

- [Presentation PDF](./typescript-presentation.pdf)

Examples
--------

The core of the presentation walked through a series of code examples to explore
the syntax and features of the TypeScript type system, and how it interacts with
librarires like React & Apollo.

To poke around with the examples, first run `npm install`, and then open any of
the examples in your editor. VS Code will give you best results as it will
automatically watch and compile the examples, so you'll see feedback on type
erros and warnings as you type things out.
